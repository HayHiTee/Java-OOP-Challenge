# Object Oriented Design Question

## Problem

University of Ibadan has been planning  to  implement  a  system  for  managing  a  store  for  auto parts.  A  single
part  can  be  used  for  different  car  models  and  it  has  following characteristics:  code,  name,  category
(e.g.  suspension,  tires  and  wheels, engine,  accessories  and  etc.),  purchase  price,  sale  price,  list  of
car models,  with  which  it  is  compatible  (each  car  is  described  with  brand,  model and  year  of  manufacture,
e.  g.  Hyundai C320,  2008)  and  manufacturing company.  Manufacturing  companies  are  described  with  name,
country, address,  phone  and  fax.

## Task

Design  a  set  of  classes  with  relationships  between  them,  which  model  the data  for  the  store.
Write  a  demonstration  program,  which  demonstrates the  classes  and  their  all  functionality  work  correctly
with  some  sample data.


### Hints

    1. Break down the problem into subtasks and identity the entities
    2. Describe relationship among the different entities and classes.
       Use OOP properties ( encapsulation, data abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism)
    3. Choose appropriate data structure.
    4. Use design pattern when appropriate.
    5. Test each subtask to see if it's working appropriately.
